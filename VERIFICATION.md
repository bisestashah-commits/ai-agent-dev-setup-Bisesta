Troubleshooting Documentation

Issue 1: GitHub MCP Server Failure

Problem: The github MCP server repeatedly failed to authenticate despite correcting the JSON structure and generating new PATs.

Solution: The issue was resolved by generating a new PAT with the repo scope and setting the token as a Windows System Environment Variable (GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN), forcing the variable to load reliably before the Claude process started.

Prevention: For stability, system-level environment variables should be the preferred method for sensitive secrets over application configuration files.


Final Verification Statement
I, verify that:

All 4 MCP servers are properly configured and connected
Each server has been tested and is fully functional
